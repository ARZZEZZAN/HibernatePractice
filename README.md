Simple hibernate manipulations-_-
Hibernate ORM is a library providing Object/Relational Mapping (ORM) support to applications, libraries, and frameworks.

It also provides an implementation of the JPA specification, which is the standard Java specification for ORM.

There is java classes and their presentation in the database:
- User
    -	User ID
    - Login
    -	Password
    -	List of created rooms
    -	List of chatrooms where a user socializes
- Chatroom
    -	Chatroom id
    - Chatroom name
    - Chatroom owner
    - List of messages in a chatroom
- Message
    - Message id
    - Message author
    - Message room
    - Message text
    - Message date/time
The essence of my work was an elementary transformation of a database into an object-oriented representation using the Hibernate framework!
